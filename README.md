"Ball Bearing" Part Design and Assembly in SolidWorks (Project 3)

# 🔩 Ball Bearing – SolidWorks Part & Assembly (Project 3)

(My Youtube Channel)Project Direct Youtube Link - https://youtu.be/204D_QgU_oQ

## 📌 Project Description

This is a detailed 3D model and assembly of a **Ball Bearing** created using **SolidWorks 2025**. The project includes all the individual components – inner race, outer race, cage, and balls – assembled with realistic constraints.

It demonstrates modeling and assembly skills essential for machine design, and reflects standard industrial practices in bearing design.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open `BallBearing_Assembly.SLDASM` in **SolidWorks 2020 or newer**.
2. Explore each part in the FeatureManager to understand design features.
3. Review the `Mates` section for assembly constraints like concentricity and spacing.
4. Use **Exploded View** or **Motion Study** for a clearer understanding of assembly dynamics (optional).
